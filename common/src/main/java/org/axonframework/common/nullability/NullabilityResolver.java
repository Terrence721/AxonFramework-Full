/**
 * Determines whether a {@link Parameter} is declared as accepting {@code null}.
 * <p>
 * Not every language expresses nullability through annotations that survive to runtime. Java typically uses a
 * {@code Nullable} annotation, which is read out of the box. Kotlin, on the other hand, encodes nullability in its
 * type system and compiles it to an annotation with {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#CLASS} retention,
 * which reflection cannot observe. This interface exists so such languages can contribute their own resolution
 * without the framework depending on their tooling.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are discovered through the {@link ServiceLoader} mechanism, by declaring them in a
 * {@code META-INF/services/org.axonframework.common.nullability.NullabilityResolver} file, and are consulted in
 * descending {@link org.axonframework.common.Priority} order. The first to return something other than
 * {@link Nullability#UNKNOWN} wins; implementations must report {@link Nullability#UNKNOWN} for parameters they know
 * nothing about, so that lower-priority resolvers, and finally the built-in annotation check, still get their turn.
 * <p>
 * Resolution happens while message handlers are being inspected, which is during application startup rather than per
 * message. Implementations may therefore favor accuracy over speed, but must be thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Marked {@link Internal} as the contract is still provisional. It is public only so that implementations shipping in
 * separate artifacts, such as the Kotlin extension, can reach it.
